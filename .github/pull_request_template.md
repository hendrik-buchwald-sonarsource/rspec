## Review

This section presents a comprehensive checklist for reviewers. It serves as a
guideline for the review process, detailing each task that should be
accomplished by a reviewer. It is important to note that a reviewer's
responsibilities extend beyond cursory examination. Each reviewer is required to
diligently inspect, and appropriately mark off each aspect within the given
checklist. All elements must be thoroughly verified and marked as done before
the review process can be considered complete. The approved status on the PR
should only be assigned once all the checklist items have been satisfactorily
addressed.
